# MrRazamataz-Website
The main files for my website, at mrrazamataz.ga  
This contains the files for my new website, not the old design, because that is too bad to have publicly displayed.

## Inspiration

The design I went for is based of the website of 2b2t.org, of which is currently defunct. I added better anitmations and the like.
